        <h1>How unicorns got their horns</h1>
        <p>
          It was a dark and stormy night. <span class="person1"></span>, a well-known dragon in the area was hard at work, cleaning his smelting gear.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="person2"></span>, was taking a walk, but when the black clouds and thunder rolled in, she fled to the protective shelter of the woods at the base of a mountain. In the distance a <span class="animal"></span> called to all the forest animals: "Here is a cave where you may keep dry!". <span class="exclamation"></span>, shouted <span class="person2"></span>. <span class="person2"></span> ran to the cave, where she nestled down to a warm and safe night's sleep. But, lo! Shortly before dawn, <span class="person2"></span> awoke to the sounds of a repetitive clanging noise. Opening her eyes, she perceived a bright pin point of light at the far end of the cave, opposite the entrance. Arising, she began to walk towards the pin point.
        </p>
        <p>
          But <span class="animal"></span> shouted, "Beware! You are headed to danger!". But <span class="person2"></span> was a curious colt and crept onward, toward the light and noise.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of the tunnel, she found a huge bright cavern full of treasure, and <span class="person1"></span> in the middle of it, heaving weapons, one after another, at the wall above the tunnel.  He had finished his chores early and decided to treat himself with some target practice.  At the sight of a catapult hurling a boulder towards her, she squealed <span class="fear_exclamation"></span>.  This so startled <span class="person1"></span> that he threw his next weapon, a magical <span class="weapon"></span>, directly at her face!
        </p>
        <p>
          Lucky for our cold friend, when thrown at a person, this magical <span class="weapon"></span> does not hurt them, but becomes a part of them! A bright light filled the cavern and when it faded, <span class="person2"></span> discovered that she had a beautiful silver horn attached to the middle of her forehead.
        </p>
        <p> And that is how the first unicorn got her horn</p>
